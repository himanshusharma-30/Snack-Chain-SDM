# Snack-Chain-SDM
This file contains real sales and promotions data from a large retail chain (of 79 stores) on 58 products belong to four product categories (bagged snacks, cold cereal, frozen pizza, and oral hygiene products) from multiple manufacturers

The transaction table has weekly information on price and promotions of products (e.g., whether a product was assigned a special store display, or was in an in-store circular, or had a temporary price reduction). We want to examine the effects of these pricing and promotion strategies on total spend for that product, number of households who purchased that product, and the number of store visits.
